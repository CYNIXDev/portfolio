Hello, my name is Nopparit Salasri, nickname Pai, and I am 27 years old.

My journey to becoming a Frontend Developer started when I worked in the positions of Technical Support, Graphic Design, and Web Admin. These roles allowed me to collaborate with various departments, such as:

Frontend: Providing technical support to customers facing issues that affected their ability to use the company's software.
Backend: Managing backend systems such as On-Premise & On-Cloud Servers, Database Servers, and Firewalls.
Collaborating with the Design Team to create and design promotional media such as infographics and videos for customer outreach.
Working with the Marketing Team to maintain and update information about the company's products and services on the website.
My involvement in website management introduced me to Frontend Development, a role that requires both technical skills and creativity to design visually appealing websites. With my natural curiosity and love for learning new things, I began self-studying through various online resources to become the Frontend Developer I aspire to be
